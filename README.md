The script is hosted here for legacy reasons and as far as I am aware works without issues. However, if you're still interested in using this on your site, you may do so at your own peril.

## Description
A small php script for cropping, zooming and resizing web images (jpg, png, gif). Perfect for use on blogs and other applications.
